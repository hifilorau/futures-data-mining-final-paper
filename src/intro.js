  <p>  Conversations around death in this country are a fleeting thing. We ignore, deny, and for the most part generally refuse to talk about or prepare for our own mortality. Death in the United States has been put into a box, tied with a bow, and for the most part commoditized by the death industry, whose general attitude towards the consumer is akin to, “I know it hurts, in your time of ultimate despair, we will point you towards a large number, and you will pay. It is part of the grieving process"  Needless to say, the funeral industry is very predatory in America. The average funeral in the United States costs about $8,000. Is our unwillingness to talk about death part of the problem? Does the way we grieve ultimately help create a system in which our refusal to accept and confront death make us an open target for a predatory industry? And even moreso, if they are able to take advantage of our pain, what sorts of damage are we doing to ourselves by not being able to properly express our grief when faced with death.</p> 

<p>In this paper we are looking at dataset from tweets mentioning the word “death” in four different languages, English, Dutch, Spanish, and French. We will take our sentiment analysis results and place them below. And begin to imagine a world in where we can actually start to gain insights from how we talk or moreso even don't talk about death.  </p>

<p>Is it different in other countries, in other cultures? How do they talk about death? Is their similar willingness to avoid the conversation at all reflected in the cost of their funerals, in their happiness? This paper is the beginning of that exploration. What data do we have? What data do we need? And how can we start to make these connections? For me this paper is an introduction, a snapshot, it is the baseline of how we talked about death in four different western languages during one short period of time. What this paper is not, but what it opens the door to, is looking at a series of these snapshots over years of time and seeing how they change. What I would love to do ultimately is take a snapshot like this every month for 10 years but across many more languages that encompass additional cultures that handle death differently and then compare these snapshots with more traditional data on suicide, cancer, funeral costs, etc and see if there are correlations between how we talk about death, how we die, and the cost of dying. But we will save that for another day, today, let's focus on the data at hand and see what we can ascertain.
