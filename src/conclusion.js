    <h2>Conclusions: Where do we go from here?</h2>
    <p>
     I'm not sure we learned anything shockingly new with the data sets we have gathered. If anything we have reinforced the fact that the emotional responses that we elicit around death are fairly similar in western cultures. Perhaps the Danish, are a little more forward thinking and the French are slighly more negative. But maybe this could be attributed to variance, or the death of the celebrity in that country around the time of the tweets, or maybe it's just a small dataset. The real question is where can we go from here now that we have this data?
    </p>
    <p>What if we were to pull 1,000 tweets a week from each language for 10 years and see if it reflects an attitude change. Or track some cultures we know who have radically different ways of dealing with death than we have in the west. Also, if we could begin to segment based on demographics, interests, etc. What if we could find a subset of twitter users that had the most positive outlook on death based on sentient analysis. What if we could track them for five years? Are they happier, healthier, what can they teach us about life just by the way they talk about death. If we had enough data could we take an indivuals tweets about death and ascertain how happy they are, or how likely they are to kill themselves? Can we used unsupervised models to find patterns in how they tweet with their life? I think we would need to cross section this data with other personal of data of theirs, but I think there is a world in our not to distant future where we can use assocition rules, and neural nets to start to connect some dots but I think we would have to find a test group of users who would let us track them across multiple social media outlets (ie... twitter + facebook). 
      
      It would be fascinating to look at funeral costs cross sectioned with sentiment analysis. After some preliminary reseach and it looks like the cost of a funeral might be slightly higher in France than in the United States once you calcuate in cemetary services. Does France's more negative outlook on death mean they hide from it even more than we do, thus allowing the French funeral industry to be even more predatory? It's hard to say, but with the correct data we could begin to make these predictions and more. 
    </p>
    <p>Either way, we have a baseline now that is one of many ways we can measure how we talk about death. The question is what can we start to learn when we put together data from multiple datasets and compare them over time. </p>
