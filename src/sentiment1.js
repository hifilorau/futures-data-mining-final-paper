<p>    Above we see the results of 1,000 tweets from each of our language sets with their total sentiment scores across each emotion tracked by bar segment color. Thus there were over 2,000 words that elicited the sentiment of trust in English tweets in our dataset and nearly 10,000 ellicits of anger. </p>  
<p>Right out of the gate I think there are some interesting takeaways. First, the emotional breakdown of the tweets is fairly consistent across languages. You could maybe make a case that there is a higher emotional response attached to French tweets with the word death in them than in our other sets as well as the inverse for the Dutch tweets, but more data would be needed to clarify in my opinion in both cases.</p>  
<p>What stands out to me in each case however is both how similar their data structures are as well as the order in which they appear. Anger sits a top them all, a detail that is both surprising, as well as a bit terrifying. If I would have had to guess the order previous to analyzing the data I would have expected fear and sadness to show up much more than anticipation and disgust.</p>
